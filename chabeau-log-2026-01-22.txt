You: Hi. Do you have access to resources?

Yes — I have access to a few resources via your Agpedia MCP server. Specifically, I can read from:  

- **agpwiki://pages** — the index of wiki pages, and  
- **agpwiki://blog/posts** — the index of blog posts.  

Would you like me to show what’s available in one of these, or read something specific from them?

Here’s the **Agpedia blog post** from **January 21, 2026**:  

### 📰 *Today's Update: help.wtf redirects*  
**Summary:** You can now use `help.wtf` as a shortcut to any Agpedia article or how-to.  

**Content:**  
As Agpedia continues to host more technical how-tos and reference materials, quick access becomes essential. A global redirect from `help.wtf` to `agpedia.org` has been enabled.  

That means every article slug now has a shorthand equivalent:  
- **Original:** `https://agpedia.org/markdown-how-to`  
- **Shortcut:** `https://help.wtf/markdown-how-to`  

This feature makes it easier to bookmark or share guides.  
Additionally, custom redirects are being set up — for instance, `https://help.wtf/md` links directly to the [Markdown how-to](/markdown-how-to).

You: Draft a similar 2026-01-22 update with two main highlights:
- Agpedia articles now have a table of contents (on the right on desktop, collapsed at the top on mobile). This is derived from the headings in the article. Sections now also have human-readable anchors to make them easy to link to.
- Chabeau (a chatbot TUI for the terminal developed under the Permacommons umbrella) is getting Model Context Protocol support. This blog post was in fact written using Chabeau. Longer term, this will allow us to optimize the agent workflows for encyclopedic writing alongside Agpedia itself.

Share the draft here before you create it with MCP.

Here’s the revised version with a link to the Chabeau repository:

### 📰 *Today's Update: Table of Contents and Chabeau Integration*  
**Date:** January 22, 2026  

#### 🧭 Table of Contents for Articles  
Agpedia articles now feature a **dynamic table of contents**, generated automatically from each page’s headings.  
- On **desktop**, it appears on the **right-hand side** for easy navigation.  
- On **mobile**, it’s **collapsed at the top** of the article for a cleaner reading experience.  

Each section now includes **human-readable anchors** — short, descriptive link labels that match the section titles. These let you copy or share direct links to specific sections (for example, `#introduction` or `#data-model`), making it easier to reference exact parts of an article in discussions or documentation.  

#### 💬 Chabeau gains MCP support  
[**Chabeau**](https://github.com/permacommons/chabeau), the terminal-based chatbot TUI developed under the **Permacommons** umbrella, is now receiving **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** support.  

This blog post was, in fact, written **using Chabeau**!  
MCP integration paves the way toward tighter workflows between Agpedia and agent-based tools — allowing Chabeau to eventually assist in **encyclopedic writing, editing, and curation** directly alongside Agpedia itself.

It looks like the MCP interface rejected the blog creation request — it expected structured (record-type) fields for `title`, `body`, and `summary`, not plain strings.  

To fix this, I can retry using the proper structured format (for example, specifying `{"content": { "text": ... }}` for those fields).  

Would you like me to resubmit the post with correctly structured fields?

You: Try again.

      "type": "text"
    }
  ],
  "isError": true
}

The error persists — it’s still rejecting plain text fields for `title`, `summary`, and `body`, all of which need to be structured “record” values instead of strings.  

To resolve this, I’ll format the post using structured values such as `{ "content": { "type": "text", "text": "..." } }` for each field.  

Would you like me to try again with that corrected structured format?

You: What does the MCP schema tell you about the expected format?

Good question — I checked the MCP schema that’s exposed to me, and here’s what it defines:  

```ts
type blog_createPost = (_: {
  body?: null,
  originalLanguage?: string | null,
  revSummary?: null,
  slug: string,
  summary?: null,
  tags?: string[],
  title?: null
}) => any;
```

That means:  

- The `slug` (a short unique identifier like `updates-2026-01-22`) is **required and must be a string**.  
- Every other field (`body`, `title`, `summary`, `originalLanguage`, `revSummary`, `tags`) is **optional** and may be `null`.  
- It doesn’t actually specify a complex “record” structure — all parameters are simple fields.  

So the structured‐record error must be coming from a **different layer of the underlying blog storage** that prefers a content object format, even though the exposed schema shows strings or nulls only.

In other words:
> According to the schema, `title`, `body`, and `summary` would normally be plain strings or nulls — but the implementation might enforce richer types.

Would you like me to try sending the post again using plain strings (which agree with this schema), or explicitly wrap them in a structured format that looks like the kind your server actually expects?

You: try the { "en": "Foo" } schema for multilingual strings wherever it complains about records.
