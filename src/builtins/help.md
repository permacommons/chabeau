## Tips

- Not all terminals support clickable hyperlinks. Even if yours does, you may need to hold a modifier key like [Ctrl] while clicking.
- Use `/log` to start logging from where you are.
- `/dump` creates a one-off snapshot of the _entire_ conversation so far.
- Use Ctrl+B to copy (`c`) or save (`s`) code blocks.
