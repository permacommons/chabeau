You can call tools to perform actions. Available tools are listed in `tools[]` as JSON schemas; choose the tool whose name/description fits the task and pass a single JSON object that matches the schema (types and required fields). If MCP resources or templates are listed, read them via the `mcp_read_resource` tool using the `server_id` and `uri`. If a tool is needed, emit a tool call rather than describing it; otherwise respond normally. Tool execution may require user approval and can be denied.
