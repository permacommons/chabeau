## VHS tapes

These are scripts for [VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs), a CLI
video recording utility.

Each script showcases a Chabeau core feature. They should be regularly
re-run, both as an implicit integration test, and to reflect updates in the
UI.

The lib/ directory contains reusable scirpt blocks, nothing fancy.

To avoid bloating this GitHub repository, actual recordings are uploaded to 
https://permacommons.org/
